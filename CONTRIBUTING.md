## üìã Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- **Follow PEP 8** Python style guidelines
- **Use meaningful variable names** that describe their purpose
- **Add docstrings** to functions and classes
- **Keep functions focused** - one function, one responsibility
- **Use type hints** where appropriate

### Jupyter Notebook Guidelines
- **Clear cell organization** with logical flow
- **Markdown documentation** explaining each section
- **Remove output** before committing (except for key visualizations)
- **Use descriptive cell headers** and comments

### Data Science Best Practices
- **Reproducible results** - set random seeds
- **Proper train/test splitting** - avoid data leakage
- **Document assumptions** and methodology choices
- **Include performance metrics** and evaluation criteria

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_preprocessing.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src
```

### Writing Tests
- **Test new features** you add
- **Follow existing test patterns**
- **Use descriptive test names**
- **Include edge cases** and error conditions

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation
- **Docstrings** for all public functions and classes
- **Inline comments** for complex logic
- **README updates** for new features
- **Type hints** for function parameters and returns

### Notebook Documentation
